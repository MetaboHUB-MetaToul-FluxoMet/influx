Introduction
============

``influx_s`` is a software designed for flux calculation based on
labeling data using 13C isotope. Since the version 2.0 it calculates also metabolite concentrations. The fluxes and metabolite concentrations are calculated in
metabolically and isotopically stationary mode. Their values are obtained
as a result of a fitting between simulated labeling data and the data measured
by MS or NMR techniques. In this documentation the terms `fitting` and `optimization`
are used as synonyms. For the theory behind flux calculations see the following papers:

A methodology behind metabolite concentration evaluation is not yet published at the moment of this writing.

The main additional value to flux calculation of ``influx_s`` compared to other publicly
available software (`13CFlux <https://www.13cflux.net>`_,
`OpenFlux <http://openflux.sourceforge.net/>`_, ...)
is the usage of NLSIC algorithm
for fitting purposes. This algorithm provides:

 - more reliable convergence which results in better numerical precision, i.e. even started from random initial points, it converges to the same solution if no local minima are present. So the spread of final solutions is close to zero.
 - better accuracy, i.e. the found numerical solution lies closer to the theoretical solution than solutions provided by concurent minimization algorithms. Thus, ``influx_s`` provides better numerical accuracy.
 
For more details, see the paper on ``influx_s`` cited here before.

Changes brought to this new version and bug fixes are resumed in
the chapter :doc:`Change Log<changelog>`.

This documentation is organized as follows. :doc:`Installation <install>`
chapter provides brief instructions for software installation. :doc:`Quick start
<quick>` chapter gives an opportunity to a user to quickly start and
evaluate the software and to see if it corresponds to what he is looking for. A
more detailed but short :doc:`User's manual <manual>` precedes a
:doc:`Programmer's documentation <progdoc>`. The latter chapter can be safely
skipped by a user not interested in developing new features or fixing some
problems in ``influx_s``. A small collection of :doc:`How to... <howto>` and
:doc:`Troubleshooting <trouble>` notice are concluding the documentation.
