Introduction
============

``influx_s`` is a software designed for flux calculation based on
labeling data using 13C isotop. The fluxes are calculated in
metabolically and isotopically stationary mode. Their values are obtained
as a result of a fitting between simulated labeling data and the data measured
by MS or NMR techniques. In this documentation the terms `fitting` and `optimization`
are used as synonyms. For the theory behind these calculations see the following papers:

The main additional value of this program compared to other publicly
available software (`13CFlux <https://www.13cflux.net>`_, `OpenFlux <http://openflux.sourceforge.net/>`_, ...) is the usage of NLSIC algorithm
for fitting purposes. This algorithm provides:

 - more reliable convergence (even started from random initial points it converges to the same solution if no local minima are present)
 - better accuracy (the found solution has better numerical precision due to a particular stopping criterion).
For more details, see the paper on ``influx_s`` cited here before.

This documentation is organized as follows. :doc:`Installation <install>`
chapter provides brief instructions for software installation. :doc:`Quick start
<quick>` chapter gives an opportunity to a user in a hurry to quickly start and
evaluate the software and to see if it corresponds to what he is looking for. A
more detailed but short :doc:`User's manual <manual>` precedes a
:doc:`Programmer's documentation <progdoc>`. The latter chapter can be safely
skipped by a user not having in a project to develop new features or to fix some
problems in ``influx_s``. A small collection of :doc:`How to... <howto>` and
:doc:`Troubleshooting <trouble>` notice are concluding the documentation.
