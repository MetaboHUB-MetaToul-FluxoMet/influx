Change Log for influx_s
=======================================


2013-02-01 version 2.0
----------------------

New features:
 - metabolite pooling is modeled. Such pooling can appear due to compartmentation phenomenon or due to isomer coelutions in chromatography. Starting from this version, metabolite concentartions can be part of fitted parameters;
 - adaptive backtraking algorithm is intorduced to NLICS algorithm;
 - history of convergence during minimization can be retrieved;
 - symbolic equations for dependent fluxes expressed as functions of free and constrained fluxes are generated by ftbl2cumoAb.py script;
 - METAB_MEASUREMENTS section is added to FTBL format;
 - added :math:`\chi^2` test for evaluating the goodness of fit;
 - removed ``metab_scale`` field from OPTIONS section in FTBL format;
 - "dead end" internal metabolites are allowed in a network without being an output metabolite. As consequence, input-output fluxes must be explicitly declared as non reversibles in the FTBL;
 - added optional EMU framework (``--emu``);
 - added optional series of starting points, fixed or randomly generated
   (``--fseries``, ``--iseries``);
 - matrix construction is reworked and fortran code is removed. Now, no more ``Rtool`` installation is requiered for running ``influx_s``;
 - some error messages are made more explicit and more precise;
 - outdated R package ``fUtilities`` is no more required;

Bug fixes:
 - fixed stoechiometric matrix construction when for a given metabolite
   all fluxes are free or constrained;
 - fixed candidate propositions for free fluxes;
 - fixed standart deviation value for a ``DD/T`` field in ``PEAK_MEASUREMENTS`` section.

2011-10-11 version 1.0
----------------------

Initial release. Main features:
 - NLSIC algorithm;
 - FTBL input format from 13CFlux project;
 - reduced cumomer set for cumomer balance equations;
 - sparse matrices;
 - usage of ``multicore`` R package for Monte-Carlo simulations on Unix platform;
 - usable on platforms having Python+numpy and R+some modules;
 - comand line interface;
 - brief user's and programmer's documentation;
 - OpenSource (ECL) license.
