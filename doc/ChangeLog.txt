Change Log for influx_s
=======================================


2013-03-13 version 2.2
----------------------
New features:
 - if more than one FTBL file is given in argument to ``influx_s``, all files are proceeded simultaneously in independent processes;
 - outliers in measurements can be automatically detected and excluded from parameter fitting.

Bug fixes:
 - fixed an error preventing Monte-Carlo results to be written if ``multicore`` package is not installed;
 - fixed a documentation error about :math:`\ln(M)` in ``mynetwork.pres.csv`` file;
 - fixed warning resuming if there are many of them;
 - fixed some error message generation on FTBL parsing.

2013-02-15 version 2.1
----------------------
New features:
 - in nlsic() a new field 'retres' is added to the list of returned values. It transfers "as is" the list returned by a last call to residual calculation function;
 - added a writing of generalized inverse of Jacobian to the result file;

Bug fix:
 - fixed a typo preventing Monte-Carlo statistics on forward-reverse fluxes to be written in the result file.

2013-02-05 version 2.0
----------------------

New features:
 - metabolite pooling is modeled. Such pooling can appear due to compartmentation phenomenon or due to isomer coelutions in chromatography. Starting from this version, metabolite concentrations can be part of fitted parameters;
 - adaptive backtracking algorithm is introduced to NLSIC algorithm;
 - history of convergence during minimization can be retrieved;
 - symbolic equations for dependent fluxes expressed as functions of free and constrained fluxes are generated by ftbl2cumoAb.py script;
 - METAB_MEASUREMENTS section is added to FTBL format;
 - added :math:`\chi^2` test for evaluating the goodness of fit;
 - removed ``metab_scale`` field from OPTIONS section in FTBL format;
 - "dead end" internal metabolites are allowed in a network without being an output metabolite. As consequence, input-output fluxes must be explicitly declared as non reversibles in the FTBL;
 - added optional EMU framework (``--emu``);
 - added optional series of starting points, fixed or randomly generated
   (``--fseries``, ``--iseries``);
 - matrix construction is reworked and fortran code is removed. Now, no more ``Rtool`` installation is required for running ``influx_s``;
 - some error messages are made more explicit and more precise;
 - outdated R package ``fUtilities`` is no more required;

Bug fixes:
 - fixed stoichiometric matrix construction when for a given metabolite;
   all fluxes are free or constrained;
 - fixed candidate propositions for free fluxes;
 - fixed standard deviation value for a ``DD/T`` field in ``PEAK_MEASUREMENTS`` section.

2011-10-11 version 1.0
----------------------

Initial release. Main features:
 - NLSIC algorithm;
 - FTBL input format from 13CFlux project;
 - reduced cumomer set for cumomer balance equations;
 - sparse matrices;
 - usage of ``multicore`` R package for Monte-Carlo simulations on Unix platform;
 - usable on platforms having Python+numpy and R+some modules;
 - command line interface;
 - brief user's and programmer's documentation;
 - OpenSource (ECL) license.
